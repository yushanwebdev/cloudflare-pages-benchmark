# Cloudflare Workers Benchmark

The project serves as an experimental platform to evaluate and compare the performance characteristics of different meta frameworks when deployed to Cloudflare's edge network.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to conduct comprehensive performance benchmarking across various meta frameworks to:

- Identify which meta framework delivers optimal performance on Cloudflare Pages
- Compare rendering strategies and their impact on edge performance
- Measure key metrics such as Time-to-First-Byte (TTFB), First Contentful Paint (FCP), and overall runtime performance
- Provide data-driven insights for choosing the most performant meta framework for edge deployments
